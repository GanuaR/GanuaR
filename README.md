## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
ðŸŒ± Breeding Genetics Student | Life Sciences Enthusiast | Bioinformatics Explorer

Welcome to my GitHub space! Here, I combine my passion for genetic improvement and computational biology to explore the fascinating world of life sciences.

ðŸ”¬ What Iâ€™m focused on:

Bridging traditional breeding methods with modern bioinformatics tools.

Analyzing genomic data to uncover patterns in heredity and diversity.

Learning (and applying!) new techniques in data science for biological research.

ðŸ’¡ Always curious about open-source bioinformatics projects, collaborative research, and mentorship opportunities. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss ideas, share knowledge, or collaborate!
